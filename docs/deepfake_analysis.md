# 🔥 DEEPFAKE ANALYSIS - CRITICAL FINDINGS

## THE PROBLEM
Non-consensual deepfake pornography is rapidly spreading on the internet. Victims (mostly women) face severe psychological trauma, blackmail, and harassment. Current detection systems fail on real-world deepfakes (45-50% accuracy drop from academic benchmarks).

## DEEPFAKE TYPES & DETECTION DIFFICULTY

### 1. Face-Swap Deepfakes (FaceSwap, DeepFaceLive)
- **What:** Real face placed on other body
- **Example:** Shridevi's face on dancer's body
- **Detection Difficulty:** EASY (96%+ detectable)
- **Artifacts:** Blending edges, texture mismatch, compression artifacts
- **Your detector:** EXCELLENT here

### 2. Lip-Sync Deepfakes (Wav2Lip)
- **What:** Face stays same, mouth moves to different audio
- **Example:** Actor saying different dialogue
- **Detection Difficulty:** MEDIUM (85-90% detectable)
- **Artifacts:** Subtle mouth movements, audio-visual sync issues
- **Your detector:** GOOD here

### 3. Real-Time Deepfakes (DeepFaceLive)
- **What:** Live streaming with fake face in real-time
- **Example:** Live video call with fake identity
- **Detection Difficulty:** HARD (88-95% detectable)
- **Artifacts:** Frame consistency issues, blink patterns
- **Your detector:** CHALLENGING but doable

### 4. AI-Generated Videos (Future - NOT Phase 1)
- **What:** Completely AI-created person/scene
- **Example:** SORA videos of synthetic people
- **Detection Difficulty:** VERY HARD (different problem)
- **Your detector:** Phase 2 (not Phase 1)
